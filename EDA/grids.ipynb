    "### How is the following logic supposed to work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Context: We need to identify vertices for our vertex-edge graph representation of the transmissions grid.\n",
    "Problem: To distinguish vertices that are close together, we need to use a combination of substation names and coordinates. As multiple substations can share a name, multiple substations can be near each other with different names, a single substation can fail to have common coordinates because of data quality issues, coordinates can connect but incorrectly not share a substation name, and we only have access to edge-level data (which contains name and coord information about their endpoints but the connection isn't indicated at row-level data), this is quite complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of problem nodes:\n",
    "PINEVILLE.png, which is a large substation and has transmission lines connecting to it at two different coordinates. This substation should be classified as one vertex on our graph, and each edge that connects to either of the two points should connect to the one vertex.\n",
    "MIDWAY, which is a name that belongs to 3(?) substations across the US. \n",
    "some random point in the Louisiana islands has three points which should connect but don't their coordinates don't quite meet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Round each substation's coordinates to 2 decimal points and COUNT the lines that have it as an endpoint. This will turn cases like PINEVILLE into a single substation. From this level of precision, there are still some coordinates that are very near to each other yet not grouped together, so there's still the question of which one corresponds to the substation. These could be the other ends of the transmission lines or other parts of the substation. So, we need to aggregate each substation's coordinates to 1 decimal point and COUNT because that is coarse enough to group all of these possibilities together into one point. Join these two views together on substation and coordinates rounded to 1 decimal point and calculate the two COUNTs from before. The proper substation coordinate is the coordinate in the row with the highest COUNT for each substation-coarse-coordinate combo. \n",
    "\n",
    "Result: This isn't quite right because some substations that have two coordinates have many connections to both coordinates, so though each connection is a plurality they are not majorities (see CHESTERFIELD.png). I might need to have a more clever aggregation system than simply rounding. This is furthered by the fact that some stations that are very close together simply aren't being rounded together as I'd like them to because ROUND is too simple an algorithm. For example, rounding to the tens place would put 34.9 and 35.1 in different bins, rounding to the nearest 5 would put 37.51 and 37.48 in different bins, and so on. I'm thinking of using a dual-bin system, where I make bins of coord-subs rounded to the nearest 2 and the nearest 1, and make a 2-part decision. If coord-sub combos are placed in different ones bins yet the same twos bin, then they go together, and if they go in the same ones bin they go together. Still this seems to be sus in cases on the edge, e.g. 37.1 and 38.9 would be placed in the 38s bin, but maybe they're too far apart? Perhaps I just need smaller bins.  "

For example, the filter below shows that -80.416 is the true value because it has way more edges going into it and is a superset of the alternative. The alternative are simply three edges that come from a common, different place and end up in Midway. Figure out how to code this up in SQL."
