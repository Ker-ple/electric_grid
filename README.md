# Identification of key nodes in the US power grid

### Purpose 
This is a project to investigate the robustness of the US power transmissions grid. You can think of it as a bidirectional vertex-edge graph, where transmission lines are edges, and infrastructure such as their connections, power plants or transformers are nodes. Given this representation, you could determine which line(s) are most crucial in the sense that there are relatively few alterative paths in case the line(s) goes down.


### Data Source
Transmission lines from the [US Energy Atlas](https://atlas.eia.gov/datasets/geoplatform::transmission-lines/explore?filters=eyJWT0xUQUdFIjpbLTk5OTk5OSwtNDU3OC4xNl19&location=30.041305%2C-92.637992%2C22.42)
